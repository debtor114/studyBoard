**Path:** Sequence of vertices connected by edges. 

**Cycle:** Path whose first and last vertices are the same.

Two vertices are connected if there is a path between them.





#### Graph processing problems

**Path**. Is there a path between *s* and *t* ?

**Shortest path.**  What is the shortest path between *s* and *t* ?

**Cycle**.  Is there a cycle in the graph?

**Euler tour**.  Is there a cycle that uses each edge exactly once? 

**Hamilton tour**. Is there a cycle that uses each vertex exactly once.

**Connectivity. ** Is there a way to connect all of the vertices?

**MST**.  What is the best way to connect all of the vertices?

**Biconnectivity.**  Is there a vertex whose removal disconnects the graph?

**Planarity.** Can you draw the graph in the plane with no crossing edges 

**Graph isomorphism.** Do two adjacency lists represent the same graph?





#### Implementation

```c
// graph.h
// a structure to represent an adjacency list node

typedef struct GNode *pGNode;
typedef struct GNode {
  int item;
  pGNode next; 
} GNode;

// a structure to represent a graph.
// a graph is an array of adjacency lists.
// size of will be V (number of vertices in graph)
typedef struct Graph *pGraph; 
typedef struct Graph {
  int V; // number of vertices in the graph 
  int E; // number of edges in the graph 
  pGNode adj; // an array of adjacency lists
} Graph;


pGNode newGNode(int item) {
  pGNode node = (pGNode)malloc(sizeof(GNode)); assert(node != NULL);
  node->item = item;
  node->next = NULL;
  return node;
}


pGraph newGraph(int V) {
  pGraph g = (pGraph) malloc(sizeof(Graph)); 
  assert(g != NULL) ;
  g->V = V;
  g->E = 0;
  
// create an array of adjacency list. size of array will be V 
  
  g->adj = (pGNode)malloc(V * sizeof(GNode)); 
  assert(g->adj != NULL);
  
// initialize each adjacency list as empty by making head as NULL;

 for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
  	g->adj[i].next = NULL; 
  	g->adj[i].item = i
 }
  return g; 

}


// add an edge to an undirected graph
 void addEdgeUniDirection(pGraph g, int v, int w) {
   // add an edge from v to w.
   // A new node is added to the adjacency list of v.
   // The node is added at the beginning
   
   pGNode node = newGNode(w);
   node->next = g->adj[v].next;
   g->adj[v].next = node;
 }

// add an edge to an undirected graph
void addEdge (pGraph g, int v, int w) {
  addEdgeUniDirection(g, v, w);
  addEdgeUnidirection(g, w, v);
}
```
